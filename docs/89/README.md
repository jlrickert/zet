# Logitech G604 issues on macOS

Installed [Logitech G Hub](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/innovation/g-hub.html)

Hitting the side buttons asks for permission.  I think this has to do
with G Hub.  It is also interesting to note that some mice the side
buttons may not work without additional software.

At work the mouse was struggling to stay connected.  This doesn't occur
at home when attached to my Razer thunderbolt hub.
