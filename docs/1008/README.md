# Article: Ceroc® New Zealand Competition Rules, Categories and Judging Criteria

This document, "Ceroc® New Zealand Competition Rules, Categories and Judging Criteria (Version: April 2025)," outlines the framework for Ceroc® dance competitions in New Zealand.

Here's a summary of its key sections:

1. **Introduction & Scope:**

   - Rules for Classic and Cabaret categories are standardized across all NZ events.
   - Creative category rules can vary regionally and will be detailed by event organisers (found via www.cerocevents.co.nz).
   - Not all listed categories will be at every event.

2. **Responsibilities:**

   - **Organiser:** Ensure fair and professional events, communicate changes (e.g., cancelling/combining categories with fewer than four entries).
   - **Competitor:** Understand rules, know eligible categories, wear appropriate non-damaging shoes (heel caps for small heels), appropriate costumes, display numbers clearly, and be ready on time. Actions unacceptable in social dance are prohibited.

3. **Points System for Competitor Levels:**

   - Competitors earn points for placings, determining their level (Newcomer, Intermediate B/A, Advanced B/A, Champions).
   - Points are individual and reset to the minimum for the new level upon advancing.
   - A centralized "Points Registry" (myceroc.co.nz/registrations) tracks points.
   - Points awarded vary by category type (Classic, Cabaret, Creative) and level, with minimum entry numbers often required for points.
   - Teachers are allocated a minimum of 100 points.
   - International/NZ Modern Jive competitors have their level assessed based on prior experience.
