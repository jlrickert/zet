# Pizza night at the cabin pizza dough

This is the pizza recipe that I used for the dough to be used at cabin on August 26 2023. It is based of off the sourdough somewhat whole wheat pizza that I used at the [Finland group gamping event](keg://zettel/449). It is also targeted towards the higher heat of a pizza oven.

| Preferment | 450g   | 28%               | Around 50g of rye starter. The rest is soft whole white wheat |
| 00 Flour   | 1600g  | 100%              |                                                               |
| Water      | 930g   | 58%               |                                                               |     | Salt | 16g | 1%  |     |

Total weight is roughly 3000g. This makes roughly 12 pizzas.

## Retrospect

This batch of dough came out perfect for making new york style pizza roughly 10 inches in size. I had a tough time getting it super thin without ripping. It was rather elastic, but if worked to much it would rip. The dough seemed easiest to work with when it was at room temperature
