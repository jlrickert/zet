# Pizza night at the cabin pizza dough

This is the pizza recipe that I used for the dough to be used at cabin on August 26 2023. It is based of off the sourdough somewhat whole wheat pizza that I used at the [Finland group gamping event](keg://zettel/449).

| Ingredient | Weight | Bakers percentage | Comment                                                       |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| Preferment | 450g   | 28%               | Around 50g of rye starter. The rest is soft whole white wheat |
| 00 Flour   | 1600g  | 100%              |                                                               |
| Water      | 930g   | 58%               |                                                               |     | Salt | 16g | 1%  |     |

Total weight is roughly 3000g. This makes roughly 12 pizzas.
