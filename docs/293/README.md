# Labor day weekend bread bowl

Recipe that I used for making 2 bread bowls for labor day weekend (Friday September 1 20223). This is an interesting bake because I left my starter up at the cabin in the fridge. I was suppose to be back by Thursday night but ended up arriving on Friday morning.

## Key events

- 09:00am Fri Fed starter

  My starter has been in the fridge for like 3 days. Surprisingly, it still seems strong. Sitting on the counter for roughly 7 hours and 30 minutes at around 75f to 80f.

- 04:30pm Fri Mixed Ingredients for autolyse (no starter)
- 09:00pm Fri Placed into the fridge

  Around 10 hours in the fridge

- 07:00am Sat Shaped into bowls

  I didn't have my baneton so I used ceramic (I think) pots. I sprinked corn meal over the top to prevent from sticking.

- 11:15am Baking

  Baked for 25m at 450f and another 20m at 410f without the lid. I preheaded the oven without the dutch ovens, a large sheet of parchment paper with 2 folds, and spritzed with water before being placed inside the oven.
