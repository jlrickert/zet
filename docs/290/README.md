# Hardware: Kineses Advantage360

This is my favorite keyboard so far. Most comfortable keyboard that I have every used. Could be slightly smaller so I don't have to shift my [hand](../756) to reach the windows key. This is an ortho linear keyboard. Bought on [Amazon] for 429$.

## Notes

To change to my custom layout layout hold the gear symbol (top left of the right split) and click 1.

## My issues

- WTF num pad is being stupid. YO click 7 it will disable num lock
- Wrist pain due to twisting because hand didn't know what to do. It fixed itself after a while
- context switching between keyboards destroys typing speed
- Gaming requires space bar on left. Just move the keys around
- Unable to wake up windows with the keyboard. Have to replug it in. Works flawless on [mac](../583).

## Common issues

- Sucks for small hands
