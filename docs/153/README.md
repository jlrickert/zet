# Overview of a classic theme in WordPress

A classic theme is a more code centric way to create a theme. Although
block themes might be the recommended approach, a classic approach may
be preferred when you need more customization

Here are the required things for a classic theme, an `index.php` file
and a `style.css` file.

| File        | Required | Description |
| ----------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `index.php` | [x]      |             |
| `syle.css`  | [x]      |             |
