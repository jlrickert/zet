# Software: `Terraform` (terraform)

`Terraform` is an open source infrastructure-as-code tool that lets you define,
preview, and apply changes to cloud and on-prem resources using declarative
configuration files. It enables consistent provisioning across providers from a
single workflow and helps reduce manual configuration drift.
