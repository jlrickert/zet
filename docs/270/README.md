# Streaming setup research

In order to make things work I need to have a mic, video capture, and webcam available on a windows device with an RTX graphics card running OBS and NVIDIA Broadcast. Typically, I either game on the machine with the RTX graphics card and code in either Linux or MacOSX. It would be ideal to be able to quickly and seamlessly switch between my gaming setup and coding setup with minimal fuss.

To summarize my requirements

- Seamless switching between gaming and coding
- Capture video from 32 inch monitor on system with RTX graphics card
- 

There are possible ways that I could go about doing this. Either upgrading my old pc and switching my laptop over to linux, or buying a mac and using my laptop from streaming and gaming.

Other things that I need are lighting.

I decided to go with the libra beam.
