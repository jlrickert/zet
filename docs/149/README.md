# Useful WordPress development plugins

There are a few plugins that help during development. Here are a few
that I found from the official developer [wordpress] website. Here is
the plugins that it suggests: Debug Bar, Query Monitor, Log Deprecated
Notices, Monster Widget, and Theme-Check.

Some of the plugins require modification of the `wp-config.php` file.
