1. JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group): JPEG is the most common image format for photographs and complex images with many colors and gradients. It uses lossy compression, which means some image quality is sacrificed to reduce file size. It's ideal for photographs and images where some loss of detail is acceptable.

2. PNG (Portable Network Graphics): PNG is a lossless image format that supports transparency, making it suitable for images with sharp edges, text, logos, and graphics. It's commonly used for icons, logos, and images where preserving image quality and transparency is crucial.

3. GIF (Graphics Interchange Format): GIF is a widely used format for animated images, as it supports animation and transparency. However, it has limitations in color and is not suitable for high-quality photographs or images with many colors.

4. WebP: WebP is a modern image format developed by Google that provides both lossy and lossless compression. It generally offers better compression and smaller file sizes compared to JPEG and PNG without significantly compromising image quality. However, browser support for WebP may vary, so you may need to provide fallback formats for compatibility.

5. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics): SVG is an XML-based vector image format that is resolution-independent and ideal for simple graphics and icons. It can be scaled to any size without losing quality and is often used for responsive design and high-resolution displays.
