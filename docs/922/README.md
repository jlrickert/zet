## Amps

###

Many high-gain guitarists use a Tube Screamer pedal in front of their amp to reduce muddiness in distortion. The Tube Screamer rolls off bass frequencies, which helps to clarify the sound. Players often set the pedal's gain to low for a cleaner tone and increase the volume to boost the gain entering the amp's preamp.

## Frequencies

- **Low mids:** 200 - 400 range

  These sound nice

- **Mids:**: 2000
