# Guitar tone

## Single vs Humbucker

## Frequency responses

### **Sub-Bass Frequencies (20 Hz - 60 Hz)**

- **Character**: These frequencies provide the fundamental depth and resonance.
- **Impact on Guitar Sound**:
  - Typically not prominent in standard guitar playing, but when amplified or affected (especially in bass guitars or lower-tuned guitars), they add power and solidity.
  - Can contribute to an overall warmth if present in the guitar's design (like a thick body or certain woods).

### **Bass Frequencies (60 Hz - 250 Hz)**

- **Character**: Rich, full-bodied sound that provides the foundation.
- **Impact on Guitar Sound**:
  - Enhances the warmth and fullness of the low strings, allowing for strong chordal support.
  - Affects how the guitar sits in the mix, often giving a sense of body and depth.
  - The richness in this range can make notes sound fat and robust, particularly for rhythm playing.

### **Low Mid Frequencies (250 Hz - 500 Hz)**

- **Character**: Provides thickness and a full, round tone.
- **Impact on Guitar Sound**:
  - Contributes to the warmth of the guitar, especially in sounding full and mellow.
  - Excessive low mids can make the sound muddy, while a balanced approach enhances body without overwhelming it.
  - This range is vital for producing a smooth, bluesy sound, particularly with thicker neck profiles and humbucker pickups.

### **Mid Frequencies (500 Hz - 2 kHz)**

- **Character**: The heart of the guitar's sound; crucial for clarity and articulation.
- **Impact on Guitar Sound**:
  - Enhances the presence of the guitar, allowing notes to cut through a mix.
  - Important for the clarity of single notes and power chords, making it essential for solos and lead playing.
  - Provides a musical quality that adds texture, making the guitar sound more lively and dynamic.

### **High Mid Frequencies (2 kHz - 5 kHz)**

- **Character**: Adds brightness and clarity, often leading to harshness if overemphasized.
- **Impact on Guitar Sound**:
  - Highlights the attack and definition of strings, making riffs and solos more pronounced.
  - Balancing this range is critical: while it can add brilliance and clarity, too much can lead to a harsh tone thatâ€™s unpleasant to the ear.
  - Enhances the "snappiness" in the tone, especially noticeable in aggressive playing styles like rock and metal.

### **Presence Frequencies (5 kHz - 10 kHz)**

- **Character**: Accentuation of clarity and definition.
- **Impact on Guitar Sound**:
  - Contributes to the sparkle in the sound, making high notes and harmonics stand out.
  - Enhances the articulation of the playing techniques and string harmonics.
  - Affects how "open" or "bright" the guitar sounds, capturing the intricacies of fingerpicking or nuanced playing.

### **Brilliance Frequencies (10 kHz - 20 kHz)**

- **Character**: The air and shimmer in the sound.
- **Impact on Guitar Sound**:
  - Adds a sense of spaciousness and depth to the tone.
  - Important for defining the harmonics, giving notes a crispness.
  - While overly emphasizing this range can lead to a brittle sound, the right balance provides glistening highs that enhance musicality.

## Pickups

### Bridge pickups

- **Dreamcatcher:**

## Stuff

- sustain
- grit
- saturation
- clean vs overdriven vs distorted
- **bite:** presence of highs and mids
- **clarity:** Separation between notes
- **paralell switching:** maintains more high end frequencies increasing clarity

## Amps

###

Many high-gain guitarists use a Tube Screamer pedal in front of their amp to reduce muddiness in distortion. The Tube Screamer rolls off bass frequencies, which helps to clarify the sound. Players often set the pedal's gain to low for a cleaner tone and increase the volume to boost the gain entering the amp's preamp.

## Frequencies

- **Low mids:** 200 - 400 range

  These sound nice

- **Mids:**: 2000
