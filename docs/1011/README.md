# Dance move: First Move

This note describes the concept of the "First Move" in dancing, often referring to the initial step or leading action that begins a dance or a sequence of movements. It's fundamental to establishing rhythm, connection with a partner (if applicable), and setting the tone for the dance.

The "First Move" can vary significantly depending on the dance style:

- **In Partner Dances:** It's typically the leader's cue or step that signals the start of the dance and indicates the direction or rhythm. The follower responds to this initial lead.
- **In Solo Dances:** It's the dancer's first physical action that initiates movement, often aligned with the music's downbeat or a specific musical phrase.

Understanding the "First Move" is a key part of learning various styles like [East coast swing (ecs)](../974), [Lindy hop (lindy)](../975), [Salsa (salsa)](../977), [Bachata (bachata)](../978), and [Modern Jive (jive)](../979). Different dance studios, such as [Duende dance studio](../972), [TC Swing dance studio](../973), [Onereason dance studio](../976), and [Minneapolis salsa and bachata (msbd)](../980), will teach variations or specific techniques for starting a dance within their curriculum.

Developing a clear and confident "First Move" is crucial for effective communication and flow, whether dancing solo or with a partner.
