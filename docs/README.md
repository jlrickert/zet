# KEG Zettelkasten for Jared Rickert (jlrickert)

Hi I'm Jared. This is my personal **zettelkasten** KEG site. It contains stuff on pretty much any topic I feel like writing about, mostly about [baking](dex/baking.md), [homlabs](../578), and tech how too. You can think of it as my own personal stack overflow or arch wiki. The latest additions and changes are always [indexed](dex).

A word of caution is that these are raw notes. They may be inaccurate, messy, and/or plain misleading. Please don't quote me here as I may not still hold the same opinion on the subject. That is what my [blog] is for.

The reason that I make these notes available is that they may be helpful to some one out there.

If your curious about the whole setup for this search for the overview for [my note taking system](./649).
