# Installing patched power line fonts for MacOS

I use [nerd fonts] to provide powerline details for my prompts. I use fira code nerd font. To install go to the website and install using the builtin tools that macOS has. The only font that needs to be installed is `FiraCodeNerdFont-Retina`. Retina looks good. Haven't tried the other variations yet.

Once the fonts are installed your terminal needs to be setup.

Nerd Fonts for iTerm2

- => Preferences ( Cmd âŒ˜ + , )
- => Profiles.
- => Text.
- => Font.
- => Select "FiraCode Nerd Font"
- => (you may also want to turn on Anti-Aliasing and turn off highlight bold text)

This then needs to be setup in Iterm2
