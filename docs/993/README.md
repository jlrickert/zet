# Bake: Potluck pretzel bites

An experiment to figure out something that works better for a large group. This would be the first attempt at making pretzel bites. I am using <https://www.pantrymama.com/sourdough-discard-pretzel-bites/> as a rough guideline but am modifying it a bit. I have done something similar in the past making pretzels.

Turned out well. Maybe a bit salty but I suppose they are pretzels.

Roughly 65f inside
