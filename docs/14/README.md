# Fierce armor kit construction cost calculation

This is for crafting a bunch of fierce armor kits to level up leveling leather working on my evoker ravaire.

These calculations have been calculated on Fri 09 Dec 2022 07:50:30 PM CST during season 1 of Dragonflight.

| item                  | cost  | amount | cost  | cost for 5 |
| --------------------- | ----- | ------ | ----- | ---------- |
| awakened earth        | 400   | 10     | 4000  | 20000      |
| Stone crust Hide (3)  | 1650  | 4      | 6600  | 33000      |
| Stone crust Hide (2)  | 885   | 4      | 4425  | 22125      |
| Resilient Leather (2) | 3     | 60     | 180   | 900        |
| Resilient Leather (3) | 15    | 60     | 900   | 4500       |
| Fierce Armor Kit (2)  | 2600  | 1      | 2600  | 13000      |
| Fierce Armor Kit (3)  | 15000 | 1      | 15000 | 75000      |
| all mats (2)          | 8425  | 1      | 8425  | 42125      |
| all mats (3)          | 8425  | 1      | 10600 | 53000      |

Despite seemly looking like it is high profit a high skill is required. I am only able to create level 1 at the time.
