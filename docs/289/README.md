# Research for tendonitis issue

I have slight discomfort in my right wrist. This is especially true after using the computer all day. Some agrivators that I find is using the mouse and constantly switching between my ergonomic keyboard and regular keyboard. It is more of a dull pain low grade pain, even at rest.

  One thing that I learned from the test for this is that my right wrist is slightly worse than my left wrist. Doesn't seem to fit with the location of pain that I have.

- ulnar wrist pain

  This seems closer to what I have. There is a stretch where I feel it all up my ulnar tendon on my right side but not on my left.
