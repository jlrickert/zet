# How to utilize these notes

If you are not familiar this is a [keg]. It is a way to organize
information that inspired by the [zettalkasten] note taking system. To
get started I would use a search engine. The one that I currently use is
either `ripgrep` and `fzf` on my local system or `github` if I am on the
go. I also have a compiled version up in google drive as a temporary
solution to making my notes available. It is currently unsearchable via
search engines. However, old school [zettalkasten] style still applies.
