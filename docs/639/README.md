# Research: 2024 WiFi upgrade

My [MBP](../583) supports WiFi 6E.

My old router is [r7000](../579). I get roughly 512 Mbits/sec. Like half out on the [deck](../562).

6 vs 6E might be the same with the MBP

## RAXE300

Pros:

Cons:

- overly expensive

## wx630ep

- 2.5gb port
- power and optional POE
