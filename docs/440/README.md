# Lazy sourdough Uzbek Lepyoshki experiment

This is a last minute experiment that I tried for a 100% sourdough Uzbek Lepyoshki based on a previous [bake](../431) that I did. Some modifications that I made include more sourdough to quicken up fermentation.

| Ingredient | Amount | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| whole milk | 130g |  |
| unsalted butter | 1 TBSP |  |
| greek yogurt | 35g |  |
| Sugar | 5g |  |
| salt | 4g |  |
| levain | 125g | 100% whole wheat with roughly 2.5 hours at 66f. Probably not enough but good enough |
| Bread Flour | 275g | King Author 12.7% protein |

## Key events

- Mixed levain at 10:30am
- Mixed ingredients at 03:15pm

  Milk, sugar, salt, and butter mixed together and heated. It is then mixed in with the rest of the ingredients.

- Baked at 7:45pm

## Retrospect

I find it tasted better than the last one. A bit dense but to be expected because of the rather short rise time.
