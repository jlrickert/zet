# Hardware: My Ooni Karu 12G

The Ooni Karu 12G is an upgrade version of the Karu 12. It is a multi-fuel pizza oven that can use either wood, charcoal, or gas.

## Gas

Gas is by far the most forgiving and easiest to use. I recommended it if you have others working the pizza oven.

Hottest spot tends to be be in the center of the stone.

## Wood and charcoal

Hottest spot tends to be at the back near the fire.

The way I start it is that I place a oil soaked paper towel rolled up and place a few piece of charcoal over the top of it and the stick it in the oven and light it. As the charcoal and/or wood light I add a few more pieces. Generally, I would give about 45 minutes to get things started and get things up to temp.
