# Notes about the neurological impact of music from a podcast

I was listening to the podcast Rick Beato on [youtube] about the future of music. One thing that stood out was the push toward short songs.

## Tidbits

- Incentives to shorts songs because financial incentives for shorter songs
- 10 minutes fall into trance
  - Shamanistic rituals similar among different cultures
    - Mostly women who played drums
    - fall into a trance after 10 minutes
