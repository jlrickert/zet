# Reason why some things will not work on apple

While researching for an ergonomic vertical mouse I ran into a quote from [evoluent] on why they do not have drivers.

[evoluent]: https://evoluent.com/products/vm4r/

> Due to recent Mac OS update, our driver must be updated to maintain compatibility. We need a driver development kit from Apple but they have not replied to our request even after repeated emails. Therefore our driver development is unable to proceed. We apologize for the delay and will continue to contact Apple for the resource. Alternatively, the third party software USB Overdrive www.usboverdrive.com may be used to program the buttons on VerticalMouse. (Evoluent is not affiliated with USB Overdrive.)

Basically apple doesn't support small vendors
