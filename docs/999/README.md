### Guitar Frequency Spectrum Cheat Sheet

| String | Note | Open String Frequency (Hz) | Frequency Range (Fundamental + Harmonics) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6th (Low E) | E2 | ~82.41 Hz | ~82 Hz fundamental, harmonics at multiples (164, 246, 329 Hz, etc.) |
| 5th | A2 | ~110.00 Hz | ~110 Hz fundamental, harmonics at 220, 330, 440 Hz, etc. |
| 4th | D3 | ~146.83 Hz | ~147 Hz fundamental, harmonics at 293, 440, 587 Hz, etc. |
| 3rd | G3 | ~196.00 Hz | ~196 Hz fundamental, harmonics at 392, 588, 784 Hz, etc. |
| 2nd | B3 | ~246.94 Hz | ~247 Hz fundamental, harmonics at 494, 740, 987 Hz, etc. |
| 1st (High E) | E4 | ~329.63 Hz | ~330 Hz fundamental, harmonics at 659, 988, 1319 Hz, etc. |

### Notes:

- **Fundamental Frequency:** The lowest frequency produced by each open string.
- **Harmonics (Overtones):** Multiples of the fundamental frequency, contributing to the guitar's tonal character.
- **Playing Higher Frets:** Each fret increases pitch by a semitone; frequencies rise exponentially by the 12th root of 2 (~1.0595).
- **Frequency Range:** The guitar's overall playable frequency range spans roughly from **82 Hz (low E open string)** to about **1.3 kHz (high E note at the 24th fret)** and beyond, especially through harmonics and overtones.

### Quick Reference Frequencies for Common Notes on the Low E String

| Fret | Note    | Frequency (Hz) |
| ---- | ------- | -------------- |
| 0    | E2      | 82.41          |
| 1    | F2      | 87.31          |
| 2    | F#2/Gb2 | 92.50          |
| 3    | G2      | 98.00          |
| 4    | G#2/Ab2 | 103.83         |
| 5    | A2      | 110.00         |
| 7    | B2      | 123.47         |
| 9    | C#3/Db3 | 138.59         |
| 12   | E3      | 164.81         |

### Additional Tips:

- The fundamental frequency corresponds roughly to the pitch you hear.
- Body resonance and pickups (on electric guitars) add complexity to the frequency spectrum.
- Electric guitars often have stronger harmonics in midrange frequencies (~400 Hz to 2 kHz).
- Acoustic guitars' frequency response also includes prominent lower mids (100-300 Hz) and body resonances (around 100-200 Hz).

## Guitar Tone Descriptors and Their Frequency Spectrum Cheat Sheet

| Descriptor | Frequency Range (Hz) | Description / Effect | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Sub Bass** | 40 – 80 Hz | Very low rumble, body and fullness | Adds power and warmth to the low E string |
| **Bass / Boominess** | 80 – 200 Hz | Body, warmth, roundness; bad if overdone → "muddy" or "boomy" | Too much → "boxy" or "muddy" sound |
| **Boxy** | 200 – 400 Hz | Nasal, honky, "boxy" tone | Cutting here often clears muddiness |
| **Lower Midrange** | 250 – 600 Hz | Warmth, fullness, body | Important for thickening sound |
| **Nasal** | 400 – 800 Hz | Honky, thin, or "nasal" character | Boosting → "pinched" or "honky," cutting → clarity |
| **Presence / Definition** | 1 kHz – 3 kHz | Clarity, attack, pick definition, "snap" | Most important region for guitar presence |
| **Clarity and Attack** | 2 kHz – 5 kHz | Crispness, pick attack, articulation | Boosting adds clarity and "string noise" |
| **Sparkle / Brightness** | 5 kHz – 8 kHz | Brilliance, air, sparkle | Adds "shine," too much → harshness |
| **Hardness / Harshness** | 2 kHz – 6 kHz | Can make sound brittle or harsh if boosted too much | Be careful with boosting around 3-5 kHz |
| **Sibilance / String Noise** | 6 kHz – 10 kHz | Scratchiness, excessive string or pick noise | Use gently or selectively |
| **Air / Openness** | 8 kHz – 12 kHz | Extreme high-end airiness | Adds open, shimmering sound |

### Explanation of Terms in Context of Guitar Tone

- **Boxy**: Caused by excessive energy around 200–400 Hz, often giving a "closed-in" or "muddy" sound like playing inside a box.
- **Nasal**: More honky or pinched, linked to 400–800 Hz — over-boosting can make the guitar sound like a kazoo or trumpet.
- **Presence**: Frequencies around 1-3 kHz bring pick attack and definition, making the guitar more "in your face."
- **Clarity**: Higher mids (2-5 kHz) help the string articulation shine through, aiding note separation and detail.
- **Sparkle**: Bright, shimmering sounds in 5-8 kHz region — good for acoustic guitars or clean electric guitar tones.
- **Hardness**: When boosts in 2-6 kHz are overdone or the tone is harsh and biting.
- **Air**: Very high frequencies (8kHz and above) that contribute to brightness and openness.

### EQ Tips Based on This Cheat Sheet

- To reduce **boxiness**, cut around 200–400 Hz.
- To add **warmth** or **body**, slightly boost 100–200 Hz.
- To reduce **nasal** character, cut 400–800 Hz.
- For more **presence** and **attack**, boost 1–3 kHz gently.
- For adding **sparkle** or "shine," a small boost at 5–8 kHz helps.
- To tame **harshness**, cut or narrow reduce 3–6 kHz.
- To add **airiness**, boost 8 kHz+, but with care to avoid hiss.
