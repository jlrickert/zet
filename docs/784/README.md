# [x] TS140 Task: Installing upgrades to TS140

Installing the required hardware to meet the [requirements](../704) on my [ts140](../563) to run [TrueNas](../676).

## Ram upgrade

Added 32G of ram. 4 new sticks. Went flawlessly

## Hard drives

Wrong brackets for 5.25 to 3.5. The hard drive brackets where missing the pins in the bag so completely worthless. My hard drives are just hanging around in the case.

They do feel hot so I may nee to pay attention to that. Maybe a new case with fans.
