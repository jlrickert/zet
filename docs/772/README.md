# [x] Homelab Task: OPNSense installation on Beelink EQ12 N1000

First OS installation on my [beelink](../699).

Initial password is `opnsense` (yes I changed it)

## DHCP

Initially used KEA for dhcp. Using the ISC DHCPv4 for now because I don't know how to set the DNS on it.

Follow [how to] for setting up WireGuard.
