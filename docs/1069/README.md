# Sourdough baking (sourdough)

Sourdough is a type of bread made using a naturally fermented mixture of flour and water, known as a starter. This starter contains wild yeast and beneficial bacteria, which leaven the dough and give sourdough its characteristic tangy flavor and chewy texture. Unlike breads made with commercial yeast, sourdough fermentation is slower and can enhance the bread's flavor, texture, and shelf life.

## Bakers Percentage

Bakers percentage is a method used in baking to express the ratio of each ingredient to the total flour weight in a recipe. The flour is always set at 100%, and all other ingredients are expressed as a percentage of the flour weight. This system helps bakers easily scale recipes and understand the hydration and composition of doughs.

For example, if a recipe has 1000g of flour and 700g of water, the water is 70% of the flour weight, so the baker's percentage for water is 70%.

This method is commonly used in bread baking, especially for sourdough and artisan breads, to maintain consistency and control over dough hydration and fermentation.

## Example Table

| Ingredient | Weight | Bakers Percentage | Comment         |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Flour      | 1000g  | 100%              | Base ingredient |
| Water      | 700g   | 70%               | Hydration level |
| Starter    | 200g   | 20%               | Leavening agent |
| Salt       | 20g    | 2%                | Flavor enhancer |

The total weight of the dough is the sum of all ingredients, but the baker's percentages always relate back to the flour weight.

## Benefits

- Easy scaling of recipes
- Clear understanding of hydration levels
- Consistent dough characteristics across batches
