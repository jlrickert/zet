# Types of sourdough preferments

A sourdough preferment is the type of mixture that combines a starter with other ingredients to be used in a sourdough recipe. Usually, it takes roughly 6 hours for the preferment to be mature for use in a recipe. Time varies widely though.

## Types

Here are my classifications of the different types of preferments used. These may differ compared to where you might find else where.

- Traditional liquid starter

  This is typically a 1:1:1 ratio of starter, flour, and water The flour is typically anything glutenous

- Traditional stiff starter

  This is typically a 1:2:1 ratio of starter, flour, and water. The flour is typically anything glutenous

- Poolish

- Bigga

  Is an indirect dough. Typically drier such as a 2 to 1 ratio. Typically a long ferment.

- Cold fermented Bigga

  Is an indirect dough. Typically drier such as a 2 to 1 ratio. Typically a long ferment. The initial ferment is done in the fridge.
