# Refurbished enterprise data center HDD for NAS

Turns out there are a lot of refurbished HDD that you can find like half off compared to an equivalent NAS drives. Only issue is that they may be loud and require additional cooling.

Look for EXOS, HGST, and other data center HDD providers.

| Brand        | Model        | Speed   | year |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------- | ---- |
| Seagate Exos | ST4000NM0035 | 169/163 | 2016 |

ST4000NM0035 seems to be a newer model than some of the other on amazon. A bit faster speed for the same price.
