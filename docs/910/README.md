# Bake: More Rye-Based Sourdough Loaf

This rye-forward loaf is an adaptation of the [labor day 2024 bread bowl](../827). A bit of an experiment as I haven't made one in a while. The recipe emphasizes a higher proportion of rye flour to develop a distinct flavor and texture, perfect for rye enthusiasts.
