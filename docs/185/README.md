# Managing styles for block theme in WordPress

Themes are mainly managed in the `theme.json` file. There are 2 main parts that we care about, [styles], and [settings].

[styles] are what is actually applied by default to the website blocks.

[settings] is what the end user is allows to do in the editor.

The complete list of blocks may be found in the block editor [reference] guide. To use the block replace `core/` with `wp:`.
