# Prompt: Instructions for commenting code

## How to Comment Code

1. **Determine Purpose**: Identify the main purpose of the function or code block.
2. **Select Comment Style**: Use the appropriate syntax for the programming language (e.g., // for single-line, /_ ... _/ for multi-line).
3. **Write a Brief Description**: Summarize what the function does without detailing implementation.
4. **Use Docblock Format**: For functions, include a docblock with a brief description, parameters, and return values if applicable.
5. **Preserve Indentation**: Maintain the same indentation level as the code.
6. **Avoid Redundancy**: Exclude information that can be inferred from the code.
7. **Ensure Valid Output**: Make sure the comment format is valid for the specific programming language.
8. **Preserve Function Contents**: Ensure the functionâ€™s contents remain unchanged. It should be placed directly below the comment. It should not trigger a git diff.
9. **Output Should Be Valid for the Language**: Ensure that the comment and any related syntax conform to the requirements of the programming language being used. There should be no backticks.

Output should be valid for the language.
