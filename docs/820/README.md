**Note:**

- The weights of eggs can vary. Typically, one medium egg weighs about 50g. Adjust the weight accordingly for large or small eggs.
- The baker's percentage is based on the total weight of the flour (180g) being 100%. Other ingredients' weights are calculated as a percentage of the flour weight.
