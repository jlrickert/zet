# What is the idea width for readable text

According to an [article] that I found online the optimal line length
for body test is 50-60 characters.  If the screen is smaller aim for at
least 30-50.

Key take a ways from the [article]

- use 70ch or 34em for max-width
- line height should be 1.5em
- paragraph spacing should be 2em
- word spacing should be 0.16em
- letter spacing should be 0.12em
