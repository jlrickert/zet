# Case of using webp over png

Ran into a situation where a large image was taking forever to load on a web page. I converted it over to webp using a free tool that someone has hosted up on [heroku](../832). Big difference. Like 10th of the size with no noticeable loss in quality. The app can be found on <https://nsspot.herokuapp.com/imagetowebp/>.
