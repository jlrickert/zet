# How to get a portal mailbox in world of warcraft

The portable mail box is from the toy Katy's Stampwhistle. To obtain the
achievement Priority Mail must be completed to unlock a mini game. It must then
be completed.

The steps needed to obtain:

- Lost Mail
  Quest started from an item received from a guildy. Not sure how to obtain.
  The hand in is in the underbelly. Tunnel is towards the flight thing.

- A Huge Package
  Do the thing

- Priority delivery (take you to the frozen throne and feralas)
  Take the portal. Kill the things. Loot the thing. Go to Feralas

- Service with a smile
  Do the thing

- Do it for Twinkles
  Head over to Hillsbrad Foothills

Start the quest from the lost mail. This was sent to me from a guildy. Don't remember who

This took me like 2 hours.
