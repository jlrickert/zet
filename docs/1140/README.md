# Home assistant research

Initial research for setting up a smarthome. [Home assistant](../1141) is hosted
on my [homelab](../578).

- speakerphones for voice and speaker
- HomePod is a smart speaker and voice assistant hub
- MQTT
- IoT things separation with VLANS. Need a managed switch
- [BE550](../685) doesn't support VLANs
