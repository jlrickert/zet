# KEG repo with tina cms and jekyll experiment

This is a work in progress. This is an attempt at using tina CMS to edit and
modify my KEG repositories. What I am trying to solve is how to edit and add
entries to my keg on my phone.

```bash
bundle add webrick
```

## Retrospect

I made enough progress to relize that it doen't work well on mobile.
