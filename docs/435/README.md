# Purple radish micro green batch 1

This is a batch of [triton purple](../436) that I planted on a Thursday.

The planting process included breaking up some [coco coir](../437) into a tray
and heavily spritzing it with a water bottle. I then took small cup a filled it
with roughly 20 grams of seeds and sprinkled it evenly.

## Planting steps

- Apply bedding

  I used [coco coir](../437) that I bought in blocks from amazon. I have used in
  the past and seems to work well. At some point I hydrated the blocks with a
  good amount of water and broken it up in a bucket. The blocks where purchased
  on March 8 2021. Now it is rather dry again. I simply eye balled the amount of
  soil in the tray. Maybe like a quarter of an inch deep.

- Soil Hydration

  Spritz the living hell out of the soil. Should feel wet but not soggy. Use you
  best judgement.

- Planting

  I simply sprinkled 20 grams of seeds using a cocktail glass as evenly as
  possible.

## Key events

- Planted on Thursday before bed
- Took the lid off on Tuesday

## Retrospect

One of the things that I need to look into is soil hydration. For next time what
I might do is weigh out the coco coir and the water that I mix together.
