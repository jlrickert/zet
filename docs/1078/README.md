Text snippet from discord

XYZ: I'm looking to gauge interest in a recurring event dedicated to presenting projects you are working on or have worked on in the past. I think it would be a fun way to 1) see the cool projects everyone is working on and 2) motivate people (myself included) to finish up some of those old side projects.

I can host and we could make it really relaxed and do short presentations or demos.

Is this something people would be interested in attending?
