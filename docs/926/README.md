# Skiing in the Twin Cities

## Places to Ski

There are two primary ski systems in the Twin Cities: the **Three Rivers Park District** and the **Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board (MPRB)** trail system. There are a few that require the same pass as the one required for the State Parks as well.

### Ski Passes

Typical seasonal passes costs 90$. Probably cheaper to do the day passes mostly because of global warming issues.

- **MPRB Passes**: Can be purchased at [MPRB Ski Passes](https://runsignup.com/Race/MN/Minneapolis/MPRBSkiPasses).
