# Problem solution sets

This is an idea that I have where I create a mapping between a set problem set
and there corresponding set of solutions.  Problem sets may be mapped onto more
general sets and a problem may have multiple solutions.  As learn more about a
problem a hierarchy may form of other sub problems. Complete mastery would mean
discovery all sub problems and finding all the possible solutions.  This may be
fundamentally impossible to get to complete mastery.
