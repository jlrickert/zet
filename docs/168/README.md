# How to work with gradients with tailwind

I found a cool effect that I wanted to replicate on a [blog post] that
used gradients to get a retro terminal like effect.

Here is an example of a glowing effect at the center.

```bash
from-green-800 to-black bg-[radial-gradient(circle_at_center,var(--tw-gradient-stops))]
```

The is based on a blog post found at [log rocket].
