# The processes of migrating my private zets to my public zets

I have been slowly migration all my public zets from my private zettelkasten
into this repo. One benefit of this is that I have been moving away from pre
keg things and get a chance to update to newer patterns. This does raise the
question on how I am going to manage multiple kegs.

So far I have currently moved over all my world of warcraft notes and pop-os
notes
