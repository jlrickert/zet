# Memorial day sourdough bread bowl

This is the recipe that I used for making the bread bowl for memorial day 2023. It is based off of the [Thanksgiving bread bowl](../305).

| Ingredient | Amount | Bakers Percentage | Comment                       |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| AP flour   | 550g   | 100%              | organic ap flour from walmart |
| Water      | 375g   | 68%               |                               |
| starter    | 150g   | 27%               | 100% rye 1:1                  |

Total weight is 1085g

Baked for 38 minutes. Preheated oven for like 10. The last 8 minutes or so I pulled the lid off.
