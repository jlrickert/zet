# Hardware: Luna Leadville pacer

Running sandal made by [Luna](../717) that I bought on 2024-06-18

- 9mm stack
- sole is slippery when wet
- rubs on were the strap meets the shoe on the insides

  It gets better after 200 miles is what I have been finding

- rubs the balls of my feet if running 7 minute miles

  Haven't done enough fast runs in them yet.
