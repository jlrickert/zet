## Protocols

- Light on in the oven to maintain temperature
- Use the microwave as a proofer. Boil water in the microwave and swap with the bread. Tricky but works.

Key facts from [bobsredmill]:

- 120f will start to kill yeast
- 105f to 115f is ideal for proofing dry yeast
- 95f for activating dry yeast
- 140f for killing yeast

Handy protocols from [tastofhome]:

- keep over around 75f by using the light in the oven

Key utility from a [proofing box]:

- Maintain humidity from 60% to 70%
- Maintain temperature from 70f to 120f

Key facts from [ruuvi]:

- 72 - 77 for most doughs
- balance between to hot and too cold depending on the bread. Too hot the yeast develops before the gluten. Too cold and the gluten over develops.

Ideal dough temperature is 75-78 from [kingarthurbaking].
