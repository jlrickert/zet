# Software: Pocket

Pocket is a lightweight identity and access management option that aims to be a
simpler alternative to Keycloak. It prioritizes fast setup, clear developer
experience, and maintainable defaults while still supporting common needs such
as OAuth2, single sign-on, and basic user federation. Choose Pocket when you
want a minimal IAM that is quick to deploy and easy to integrate with web apps
and APIs. For a more feature rich, enterprise-grade solution see
[Keycloak](../1133) (`../1133`).
