# Modern jive circle

An attempt to come up with a circle similar to Salsa Rueda for
[Modern jive](../1007).

## Basics

First 4 counts the inner hands are released. Together for the last 4 counts.

## Simple swap calls

- `Rotate`: everyone swaps partners clockwise.
- `Reverse`: rotate counter-clockwise.
- `Double`: rotate two partners instead of one.

## Basic figure calls

- `Octopus`: leads send follows under both arms then rotate out (adapted from
  salsa rueda's Pulpo).
- `Windmill`: continuous hand-change turn, exit into partner swap.
- `Slide`: leaders lead a travelling return, then pass to the next partner.

## Positioning calls

- `Cross`: partners trade places through the middle of the circle.
- `Center spin`: one couple goes into the middle, does a free spin, then
  rejoins.
- `Switchback`: two couples trade across the circle instead of adjacent couples.

## Novelty calls

- `Mirror`: half the circle does the move left-handed, half right-handed.
- `Freeze`: everyone pauses one beat, then restart together.
- `Chain`: send your partner to the next leader or follow with continuous turns
  (like a contra-dance chain).
