# Uzbek Lepyoshki experiment

This is an idea that I got from a friend from Uzbekistan. This is based on a
traditional Uzbek yeast bun. My first attempt is based on a [recipe] that they
pointed out to me that looked like it online. I did tweak it in a few places
though due to an old jar of yeast. The tweaks include:

- Swapping out some whole milk and flour with starter
- Poppy seed instead of sesame seeds
- Greek yogurt instead of sour cream
- Bread flour instead of all purpose flour

Some things that I noticed is how high the hydration is. Typically, I make
simple loafs of bread with no fat in it.

## Instructions

- Other ingredients

  Yogurt, sugar, salt, and yeast are mixed together.

- Warmed ingredients

  Milk, water, and butter should be warmed up in a sauce pan to 130f. 120f
  starts killing off yeast.

- Dough ball

  Mix warmed ingredients, and other ingredients, and levain. Typically rise time
  should be around 1.5 hours to 2 hours. Once mixed the temperature was around
  90f. 82f after like an hour or so.

- Glaze

  The glaze is simply the milk and egg mixed and beaten together. Make this at
  the last minute.

- Shaping

  Typically the dough is shaped into 7 to 8 inch disks. My guess is that the
  amount of ingredients will make 2. Once shaped glaze should be applied and let
  rest for 30 through 45 minutes.

- Baking

  Bake for 35-40 minutes at 365f. Stone temperature was 385f (WHAT?). Let cool
  before serving.

## Key events

- Mixed starter at 8:00am
- Mixed ingredients at 12:15pm
- Shaped at 2:15pm
- Baked at 2:50pm
- Pulled out of oven at 3:30pm

## Retrospect

Here are a couple things that I need to pay attention to the next time I make
this

- One thing to pay attention to next time is the final temperature of the once
  the dough is mixed.
- Need to find a better way to transfer the loaves to the oven. The dough stuck
  to the parchment paper.
