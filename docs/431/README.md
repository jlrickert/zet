# Uzbek Lepyoshki experiment

This is an idea that I got from a friend from Uzbekistan. This is based on a
traditional Uzbek yeast bun. My first attempt is based on a [recipe] that I
found online but with a few small tweaks. The tweaks include:

- Swapping out some whole milk and flour with starter
- Poppy seed instead of sesame seeds
- Greek yogurt instead of sour cream

Some things that I noticed is how high the hydration is. Typically I make simple
loafs of bread with little fat in it.

## Instructions

- Other ingredients

  Yogurt, sugar, salt, and yeast are mixed together

- Warmed ingredients

  Milk, water, and butter should be warmed up in a sauce pan

- Dough ball

  Mix warmed ingredients, and other ingredients, and levain. Typically rise time
  should be around 1.5 hours to 2 hours.

- Glaze

  The glaze is simply the milk and egg mixed and beaten together. Make this at
  the last minute.

- Shaping

  Typically the dough is shaped into 7 to 8 inch disks. My guess is that the
  amount of ingredients will make 2. Once shaped glaze should be applied and let
  rest for 30 through 45 minutes

- Baking

  Bake for 35-40 minutes at 365f. Let cool before serving.
