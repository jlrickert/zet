# How to setup a contact us page in WordPress

I ran into a situation where I needed to find a way to get a production ready.

```dockerfile

```

## Key Concepts

- Contact Form 7

  This is the plugin used to create the form for the website. This is what the
  guest fills in information. This gets set off to the WordPress server to be
  then be forwarded to the clients admin email.

- DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)

  This is a signature added to emails. For development this is not needed
