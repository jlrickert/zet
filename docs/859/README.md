# Hardware: Altra lone peak 8

Trail running shoes I bought on 2024-10-16.

Pros:

- Wide toe box so no lost to nails
- Little arch support so no issues there. Arch support cause discomfort for me.

Cons:

- Too much padding. I seem to go back to my low cadence compared to minimal shoes. Slight nag in my Knees after running [Wild Duluth](../733).
