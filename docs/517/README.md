# Only fans PR move

OnlyFans dodging the bullet from a christian group trying to take down websites that have adult content. OnlyFans decided announced that they where removing adult content. When the media frenzy died down after like a week or two they reversed the decision. This way they avoided a PR hit.

I learned about this watching TheCoppinger on twitch.
