# Categorization of numbers

Numbers can be categorized in various ways, depending on the specific context and purpose. Here are some common categorizations of numbers:

- Natural Numbers: Natural numbers, also known as counting numbers, are positive whole numbers starting from 1 and continuing indefinitely (1, 2, 3, 4, ...).

- Whole Numbers: Whole numbers include zero along with the natural numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, ...). They do not include negative numbers or fractions.

- Integers: Integers are the set of whole numbers along with their negative counterparts and zero (..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...).

- Rational Numbers: Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as a fraction, where the numerator and denominator are both integers. This includes integers, fractions, and terminating or repeating decimals (e.g., 1/2, -3, 0.75).

- Irrational Numbers: Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be expressed as fractions and have an infinite number of non-repeating decimal places. Examples include π (pi) and √2 (square root of 2).

- Real Numbers: Real numbers encompass both rational and irrational numbers. They include all numbers that can be represented on the number line, including integers, fractions, and decimals.

- Complex Numbers: Complex numbers are numbers in the form a + bi, where "a" and "b" are real numbers, and "i" represents the imaginary unit (√-1). Complex numbers have both a real part and an imaginary part.

These categorizations provide a general overview, but there are more specific classifications within each category based on properties such as prime numbers, even/odd numbers, prime factorization, etc. The categorization of numbers can vary depending on the context and field of study.
