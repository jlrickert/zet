## Key events (Thursday target)

Making the batch of dough by Thursday is duable. However, there are a few hurdles. Different timing that I haven't tried, not having enough rye flour for my starter, and missing einkorn flour that I have. This changes the recipe from the one that I know works well. One advantage is that there is an extra day to ferment in the fridge.

- 12:00pm Wednesday - Mix starter

  Just pulled the starter out of the frige so it is a bit weak. Didn't seem to matter too much based on my last [bake](../293).

- 11:00pm Wednesday - (planned) Mix starter again

  I am up north currently and don't have enough rye. I could use whole wheat sourdough instead though.

- 08:00am Thursday - (planned) Autolyse pizza dough

  Mix all bit the starter. By this type the starter will be a bit ripe making for a more sour taste to the dough.

- 09:00am (Thursday) - Mix all ingredients together.

- 01:00pm (Thursday) - Knead dough

  Kneading for 4 minutes seems to be the sweet spot from what I remember. This can also be done with stretch and folds.

- 3:30pm (Thursday) - (Optional) Shape dough

  Shaping the dough this early may be challenging. The dough at the point tends to still be a shaggy mess. I typically like to shape, oil with olive oil, and place into plastic bags. This makes it easier to shape and work with when baking. This step may be skiped and done prior to baking.

- 08:00pm (Thursday) - Bulk ferment

  This is the tricky part is knowing when to put the dough in the fridge. Generally, I put in the fridge before I go to bed and pull it out 6 hours prior to using. This may sit in the fridge until maybe like.

## Key events (Friday target)

This is a time frame to consider if I am making the dough on Friday. Friday is an easier target because there is less unknowns and have all the available ingredients. It also gives more time to preshape all the dough balls.

- 12:00pm Wednesday - Mixstarter
- 10:00pm Wednesday - Mix starter again
- 10:00am Thursday - Mix starter again
- 03:00pm Thursday - Autolyse
- 04:00pm Thursday - Mix ingredients
- 06:30pm Thursday - Cold bulk ferment
- 09:00am Friday - Shape
- 12:30pm driday Ready to bake

  This is the earliest that it may be ready. I generally liked the dough better when it was left in the fridge for another day. Another thing to consider is that warm dough may be stickier and more prone to ripping. This isn't always the case.
