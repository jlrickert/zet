# Sourdough pizza dough batch request

This a batch of pizza dough that a family member wanted for a pizza party. It is based on the recipe that I used from a pizza party earlier this year.

This is a batch for 10 small 10-12 inch pizza's that should either be made by Thursday afternoon or 4:30pm on Friday.

The temperature is cooler this week. Around 75f.

## Key events (Thursday target)

Making the batch of dough by Thursday is doable. However, there are a few hurdles. Different timing that I haven't tried, not having enough rye flour for my starter, and missing einkorn flour that I have used previously. This changes the recipe from the one that I know works well. One advantage is that there is an extra day to ferment in the fridge.

- 12:00pm Wednesday - Mix starter

  Just pulled the starter out of the fridge so it is a bit weak. Didn't seem to matter too much based on my last [bake](../293).

- 11:00pm Wednesday - (planned) Mix starter again

  I am up north currently and don't have enough rye. I could use whole wheat sourdough instead though.

- 09:00am Thursday - (planned) Autolyse pizza dough

  Mix all bit the starter. By this type the starter will be a bit ripe making for a more sour taste to the dough.

- 10:00am (Thursday) - Mix all ingredients together.

- 01:00pm (Thursday) - Knead dough

  Kneading for 4 minutes seems to be the sweet spot from what I remember. This can also be done with stretch and folds.

- 3:30pm (Thursday) - (Optional) Shape dough

  Shaping the dough this early may be challenging. The dough at the point tends to still be a shaggy mess. I typically like to shape, grease with olive oil, and place into plastic bags. This makes it easier to shape and work with when baking. This step may be skipped and done prior to baking. One thing that I need to explore is how this compares to shaping just prior to using. When pulled out of the bag it tends to loose its ball shape and usually reshape prior. I just know this methods makes nice round looking pizzas.

- 08:00pm (Thursday) - Bulk ferment

  This is the tricky part is knowing when to put the dough in the fridge. Generally, I put in the fridge before I go to bed and pull it out 6 hours prior to using (guesstimate). The goal is to get the dough to the right temperature to work with. Too warm and it is sticky and likes to rip. Too cold and it is hard to get thin.

## Key events (Friday target)

This is a time frame to consider if I am making the dough on Friday. Friday is an easier target because there is less unknowns and have all the available ingredients. It also gives more time to preshape all the dough balls.

- 12:00pm Wednesday - Mix starter
- 10:30pm Wednesday - Mix starter again

  Mix before going to bed

- 10:00am Thursday - Mix starter again

  Stop by the store on the way way home to buy flour.

- 03:00pm Thursday - Autolyse
- 04:00pm Thursday - Mix ingredients
- 06:30pm Thursday - Cold bulk ferment
- 09:00am Friday - Shape dough
- 12:30pm Friday Ready to bake

  This is the earliest that it may be ready. I generally liked the dough better when it was left in the fridge for another day. Another thing to consider is that warm dough may be stickier and more prone to ripping. This isn't always the case.

## Key events

- 12:00pm Wednesday - Mix starter
- 10:30pm Wednesday - Mix starter again

  Mix before going to bed

- 12:00am Thursday - Mix starter again

- 06:00pm Thursday - Autolyse and mix rest of starter

  I forgot that I needed to make more starter than my usual. I added an addition 75g of rye and 75g of water to the 50g of starter that I had.

- 07:30pm Mixed ingredients

- 10:45pm Cold bulk ferment

## Retrospect

I choose the Friday route.

## Baking

Generally, what I found works best is get the stone as hot as possible and turn down the flame.
