# What is `mim`

Mim is [rwxrob](../80) name for a tool for managing distributed
information.  It is named after [mimir] the god of knowledge and wisdom.
His plan is to build a tool that that scrapes other peoples things and
puts it into some other format.  This is what I got out of watching
[rwxrob](../80) stream on 2023-06-25.
