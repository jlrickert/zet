# [ ] Homelab task: quick password protected https server

I need a quick way to server out some protected files out to people that is running on my [homelab](../578) so I can share nodes for my [zettelkasten](../666).

Here are my requirements:

- private content
- https enabled
- simple enough for my grandpa to view
