# Learning in public

The city of Octlantis is a hidden city of octopi off the coast of eastern
Australian. It features a series of dens with front lawns decorated with
elaborate ornamentation of shells. The inhabitants have been found to exhibit
social behavior where they interact with one another in an organized way. They
have been seen sharing dens together an exhibiting behavior of social
hierarchies. Organized societies have the advantage of better resource

Octlantis isn't the only octopus city found. There have been a couple of others
found recently. Yet despite its advantages why have they not advanced over the
generations. One observation that could be made is that they are more often than
not unruly neighbors that don't really corroborate with one another. They don't
pass down information down through the generations like we do. They don't make
the effort to teach one another.

## Facts about octopus

Other interesting facts about octopi is that they are know to be rather
intelligent. They are know to be rather crafty. For example, they have been able
to plan things several steps in advance to make an escape. They are able to
create and make tools.

## Learning in public

Advanced societies require a way to pass on knowledge between generations.
Without it things will continuously have to be relearned and little progress
will be made. One way to deal with this is to share as much as you can with
others as your learn things. I call this learning in public.

Learning in public is a way of learning that requires sharing what your learn
with others as your learn things. This can come in the form of writing down what
your learn in a format that may be consumed by others. For example, blog posts,
streaming, zettelkhasten, or a KEG. There are significant benefits to sharing
what you learn. For example, you build up a social network, others get to learn
as well, you have a record of everything you learned to make it easier to
relearn, and I find it more fun in general.

## Benefits

Having a solid social network is a requirement if you want to be gainfully
employed. Learning in public helps with this. Over time you will gain a track
record of the things that you know. Others will learn what you are good at. This
may unlock future employment opportunities.

As I learn new things typically I write them down in a Zettelkasten in
[KEG](https://github.com/rwxrob/keg-spec) format. I have this hosted up on
GitHub and served on my personal [website](https://zet.jlrickert.me) as well.
This way I have a reference to look at if I need it. It also makes it available
to others.

Other benefits is that as you share your findings with others you keep a record
of things that you have done. This is why I have a public zettelkhasten
available to all.

For developing a career a well connected network is critical. Without it, there
is no trust between individuals. Without trust most jobs are unable to be
completed.

This allows knowledge to gained personally as well as helping others out that
may have the same problems that need to be solved. It allows for building up a
network with others where every one benefits.
