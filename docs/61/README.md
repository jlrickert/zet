# How to setup fira code fonts on windows

Personally, I like the fira code fonts from [nerd fonts]. This includes all the
fancy powerline symbols. To install make sure that there is no existing fira
code packages. Install Fira Code Regular Nerd Font Complete with the build in
windows font thing. To configure applications use the string `FiraCode Nerd
Font`
