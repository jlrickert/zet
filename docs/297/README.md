# First bigga sourdough pizza batch for the Ooni

This is my first pizza dough using 00 flour. It is also my first batch to use on the Ooni with 00 flour. I made it on Thursday July 26 2023.

| Cold fermented bigga | 200g   | 45%               | This is with 2g of yeast and a small amount of honey. The flour is whole soft white wheat and the starter is 100% rye |
| 00 blue              | 525g   | 100%              |                                                                                                                       |
| Water                | 275g   | 55%               |                                                                                                                       |

Total weight is roughly 1000g. The numbers are a bit off as I didn't write them down. I suspect that the total wight and the water hydration is on though.

## Key events

- 11:00pm Thursday mixed bigga and place in the fridge overnight
- 10:00pm Friday mixed everything
- 12:00pm Friday Pulled out of the fridge
- 03:00pm Friday Shaped the pizza dough
- 10:00pm placed pizza dough back in the fridge

## Outcome

The dough collapsed by the time I got to the cabin. Still came out really good. Doesn't seem that over proofed dough has any negative affects on the pizza.

At around noon I made the pizza's. I made 5 of them. Each ball dough was roughly 200g. It is about right if you want to get the pizza dough very thin. It is a bit tricky though. It might be easier to increase to roughly 225 to 250 grams of dough to get a larger pizza and still be doable in the Ooni. Something to play around with.

The picture that I took was the last 2 pizzas. The oven got to roughly 950f for the last one. It was in the oven for maybe 2 minutes. The first one that went in the oven was like 750f. Took maybe 3 minutes or so.
