# Overview of a block theme in WordPress

A block theme is the newer and recommended way to get started when
building out a theme for WordPress. Classic theme should be used when
the site gets really complicated (this is an assumption that needs to be
verified). A fresh WordPress install will have 2 example block themes to
use for reference: `twentytwentytwo`, and `twentytwentythree`
