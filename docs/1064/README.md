# Cloud init first experience on my homelab

This is a dump of what I learned when experimenting with [cloud-init](../1065) on my [homelab](../578) with [proxmox](../635). This is what I did for the [version 2 template](../1063).

## Dump

- VM [configuration](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/explanation/configuration.html)
- [Promox support](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Cloud-Init_Support)
