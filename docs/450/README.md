# Christmas bread bowl 2023

Bread bowl for Christmas 2023 based off of the recipe that I made for labor day and the fourth of July 2023. It is a basic bread bowl with one modification. I am using garlic salt rather than sea salt. I served this with a [spinach dip](../452) that I made.

  1 hour and a half autolyse. Normally, 1 hour is how much time you want to give it. I ended up going an extra 30 minutes because I was busy with other things.

  Normally I would do some stretch and folds but I wont be home to do it.

## Retrospect

A little bit too salty and not cooked enough. Not much oven spring either. I skipped the stretch and fold part as I was busy. Really good flavor though. Seems like Mom's oven doesn't get as hot as the one that I have at home. Also, the digital scale seems really cheap and crappy. Chances are it didn't read how much salt that I added. Had to tap it to get it to read. At some point I should explored how salt effects fermentation.
