# Christmas bread bowl 2023

Bread bowl for Christmas 2023 based off of the recipe that I made for labor day and the fourth of July 2023. It is a basic bread bowl with one modification. I am using garlic salt rather than sea salt. I served this with a [spinach dip](../452) that I made.

  1 hour and a half autolyse. Normally, 1 hour is how much time you want to give it. I ended up going an extra 30 minutes because I was busy with other things.

  Normally I would do some stretch and folds but I wont be home to do it.

## Retrospect

Overall the load came out tasting really good but was a bit dense. There where a couple of problems that I ran into. Not around to work the gluten with stretch and folds. Mom's oven seemed like it didn't heat up as much compared to my oven. I baked for a longer duration that other bakes yet it came out slightly dough. It was a bit on the salty side. This could be from using garlic salt rather than sea salt and an inaccurate digital scale. At some point I should look into how much salt affects the fermentation rate.

Here is what I made with it. The dip is a [spinach dip](../452)
