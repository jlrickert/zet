# My personal PHP style guide

I don't know enough about php currently to to form my own opinion yet. There is the [wordpress] style guide and the php standards recommendation or [psr] for short.

So far here is my preferences

- Do only use `<?php ... ?>` style tags

[psr]: https://www.php-fig.org/psr/
[wordpress]: https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/

Please note this is still largely a work in progress as I learn more
