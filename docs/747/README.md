# Harrison neighborhood

Borders [Bryn Mawr](../746). Right next to high crime zones but is not nearly as bad.

Apparently gentrification going on in La Dona and Misfit Coffee.

- Broadway to Lowry in Northwest MPLS is one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city
- If there is ever any not-good activity going on in Harrison, itâ€™s typically on Glenwood between Penn Ave and Logan
