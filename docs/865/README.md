# Bonzai/hashicorp based completions in zsh

See <https://github.com/Chaitanyabsprip/zsh-self-completions/blob/main/compfix.zsh>. He got these functions from reverse engineering what ohmyzsh does.

I supplied him with the following:

- `which complete`
- `which _bash_complete`
- `which compgen`

  He actually got this from somewhere else. I think he mentioned he was doing things in containers.
