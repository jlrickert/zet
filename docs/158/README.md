# Thinking about a Zettelkasten organization as a form a taxonomy

Usually as you build up your Zettelkasten you will see patterns. There
are often nodes that have lots of links to nodes that don't tend to have
very few links. A possible way to make sense of this type of node is a
form of category.

I got this idea from the [wordpress] documentation about how posts are
organized.

In summary a category is a hierarchical taxonomy, and a tag is a non
hierarchical taxonomy.
