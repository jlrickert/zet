# My vim setup

Lately I have been using neovim rather than vim. The reason being is
that I spent some time setting up neovim and is more setup that my vim
setup currently. However, vim might be a better choice as it is more
stable than neovim. I also don't really use neovim as an IDE like I
originally planned.

```bash
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \

```
