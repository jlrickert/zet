# Swing dancing (swing)

Swing dance is a group of partner dances that originated with the swing style of jazz music in the 1920s-1940s. Characterized by its rhythmic bounce, often lively tempo, and emphasis on improvisation and connection between partners, it evolved alongside the music, adapting to different tempos and regional styles.

Different kinds of swing dance include:

- **[Lindy Hop](../975):** Considered the original and most iconic swing dance, originating in Harlem, New York. Known for its energetic "swing-out" move, acrobatics ("air steps"), and improvisation.
- **Charleston:** Popular in the 1920s and 1930s, often danced solo or with a partner. Features distinctive kicks, twists, and a rhythmic step-together tap. Can be danced to faster jazz music.
- **[East Coast Swing](../974) ([ECS](../974)):** A simpler, formalized six-count dance evolved from [Lindy Hop](../975) by dance studios. Typically danced in a circular motion with basic triple steps and rock steps.
- **West Coast Swing (WCS):** Developed in California. Danced in a "slot," with the follower traveling back and forth along a line. Known for its elastic look, smooth feel, and adaptability to a wide range of music genres beyond swing (blues, R&B, pop, hip-hop).
- **[Jive](../979):** A competitive ballroom version of swing developed in the US and UK. Faster and more structured than [Lindy Hop](../975) or [ECS](../974), featuring dynamic kicks and flicks.
- **Balboa:** Originated in Southern California. A more compact partner dance designed for fast tempos and crowded dance floors. Features intricate footwork and subtle body lead, primarily danced chest-to-chest in close embrace ("Pure Bal"). A variant, "Bal-Swing," incorporates turns and positions away from close embrace.
- **Collegiate Shag:** A partner dance originating in the Carolinas. Typically danced to speedy swing and ragtime music, featuring quick footwork, hop steps, and a distinctive athletic style.
- **[Modern Jive](../1007) / [Ceroc](../1009):** A partner dance developed more recently (late 20th century), heavily influenced by [jive](../979) and swing but simplified for accessibility. Characteristic its lack of complex footwork and emphasis on smooth, continuous turns and passes, adaptable to a wide range of popular and contemporary music. [Ceroc](../1009) is one of the major brands/styles of [Modern Jive](../1007).
