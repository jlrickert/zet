# Sourdough somewhat whole wheat pizza for the ooni

This is a large batch of pizza dough that I made on Sunday August 6th. It is meant to be used in the ooni.

The temperature is a bit cooler than normal. It is 73 as of 12:45pm sunday.

  The first was baked at 600f. The other two for 850f. All roughly 3 minutes. Seemed like they where slightliy underbaked. 4 minutes seems to be the ideal when rolling out by hand. The first 2 where left out on the counter top. I grabbed the last one out of the fridge before it was frozen. Made it harder to shape into a disk. Wanted to pull back together.
