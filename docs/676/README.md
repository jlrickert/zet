# Overview: TrueNas

On open source NAS OS based on [Debian](../674). TrueNas core is recommended as TrueNas core looks like it will sunset at some point.

Once an interface is setup with DHCP it doesn't like to be changed. Would be nice to figure out how to do static IP addresses. See [networking](../675) for ideas.
