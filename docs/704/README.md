# ts140 as a TrueNas server

A possible use of my [ts140](../563) is to run it as a NAS running [TrueNas](../676). I would need to upgrade my hardware.

Ram requirements:

- 8G min

Looks like 3 HDD will be able to saturate my 2.5G Ethernet card.

Requirements:

- need 2 5.25 to 3.5 adapters
- 6 3.50 rails
- possibly fans if using enterprise HDD
