# Hardware: Dell XPS 9710

Laptop that I purchased on 2021-10-24.

Known issues:

- track pad sucks
- Displays don't always register well when using [razer docking station](../613)
- 4k screen is nice but I wouldn't do it again.
- Screen takes excessive power.

  Unstable when running intensive apps and screen is on. I usually have the display turned off if I am not using it. Multiple hard drive corruptions due to BSOD.
