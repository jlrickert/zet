# Prompt: "Linkify" KEG notes

"Linkify" refers to the process of adding hyperlinks to specific keywords, phrases, or phrases in a text, connecting them to relevant documents, websites, or other resources within a system like your KEG. This enhances the text by providing instant access to more detailed information or related content, facilitating easy navigation and improved information retrieval from your KEG repository.

When referencing links that are not part of this KEG, it is preferred to use reference-style links for clarity and readability.

## Description of **Linkifying**

1. **Internal Linking in a Document:**

   Before linkifying:

   - "We discussed the project details in the Project Specification document."

   After linkifying:

   - "We discussed the project details in the [Project Specification](../123) document."

   Here, "Project Specification" is linked to an internal document or note with ID `123` within the same system or directory.

2. **External KEG Links:**

   Before linkifying:

   - "For functional programming concepts, see the JavaScript resources in another KEG."

   After linkifying:

   - "For a deep dive into functional programming principles within JavaScript, please refer to the external note: [Functional JavaScript in Practice](keg:js-resources/250)."

   Here, "Functional JavaScript in Practice" is linked to an external KEG using the protocol `keg`, the KEG alias `js-resources`, and the note ID `250`.

3. **Linking to External Resources:**

   Before linkifying:

   - "For more information, visit the company's homepage."

   After linkifying:

   - "For more information, visit the [company's homepage][homepage]."
   - "Visit the KEG for detailed guidance [here][keg]."

   In this example, "company's homepage" is linked to an external URL.

   Reference-style links:

   ```markdown
   [homepage]: https://www.example.com
   [keg]: https://external.keg.example.com/guide
   ```

   Using reference-style links helps manage external URLs separately, making updates easier and keeping the main text uncluttered.
