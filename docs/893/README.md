# First impressions with localai on my mac

I was experimenting with localai on my [mac](../853) as an alternative to openai. I was finding that openai gets kind of spendy when you start feeding it tons of data to use it as a search engine. I was initially checking the feasibility for use with [knut](../609) to see if a **KEG** would fit in the context window. The short answer is no. See node [894](../894) for details. I can only reasonable do like 20 nodes.
