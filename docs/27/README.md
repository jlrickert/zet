# Thanksgiving bread bowl 2022

Basic bread bowl that I made for thanksgiving. Here is the recipe:

- 150g starter (35%)
- 550 AP flour
- 375g water (65%)
- 11g salt (02%)

Total weight is 1086

I baked it at 450 for 18 minutes in the dutch oven with steam and 20
minutes without.

It was a total hit and almost gone. The smokey bacon dip that I bought at cub
was a hit as well.
