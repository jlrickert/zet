# Open-Source search engine: Meilisearch

A quick note on [Meilisearch][meilisearch], an open-source search engine,
identified as a potential component for the [Knutjs project](../609). This tool
can enable fast and relevant search capabilities for various data types within
the project's scope, including KEG notes. It aligns with previous
[research on search engines](../595).

Meilisearch is an API-first, typo-tolerant, and blazing-fast search engine that
is highly customizable and embeddable. Its focus on speed and ease of use makes
it an attractive option for integrating powerful search functionality directly
into an application like [Knutjs](../609) without the overhead of larger, more
complex solutions. Being open-source further aligns it with the project's goals.
