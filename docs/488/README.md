# Convert physically pointing to the stream to a virtual one

I have a tendency to point at the screen with my finger rather than with my mouse when I am pair programming. However, they all remote. Would I would like to do is come up with a way to highlight the thing that I am pointing at. Some thoughts would be to use a physical laser that some camera could pick up and display on a remote screens.
