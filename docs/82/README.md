# How to give credit to the original script owner

Often times I run into scripts online that I would like to adapt as my
own and modify.  It would be ideal to give the original developer credit
for the original script. My usual process has been to embed some meta
information into the header.

- Author
- License
- URL

Here is an example bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Author: Jack Rabbit
# License: Apache License 2.0
# URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repo/3533e9632c868d8383fa50b6e8fbb72c95657e6a/sshkey
```

There are more than likely better ways but this is what I have been
doing.
