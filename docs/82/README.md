# How to give credit to the original script owner

Usually I just put the following within the header:

- Author
- License
- URL

Here is an example:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Author: Jack Rabbit
# License: Apache License 2.0
# URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repo/3533e9632c868d8383fa50b6e8fbb72c95657e6a/sshkey
```
