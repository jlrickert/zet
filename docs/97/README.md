# Ergonomic mouse research

I tend to have slight discomfort in my wrist after using a regular
mouse.

My hand size is roughly 3.5 inches.

| Logitech MX Vertical |       | Works with logitech software | Forward and back may work better           |
| Evoluent VM4R        |       | No side buttons              | Possibly more comfortable than MX Vertical |
