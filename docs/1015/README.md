# Adding dark/light mode toggle to my dotfiles

Need to checkout <https://github.com/cormacrelf/dark-notify/tree/master> to see if it solves the automatic toggling of dark/light modes in neovim.

- [dotfiles](../625)
- [Terminal color](../1012)

Need to figure out a way to get zellij to automatically toggle.
