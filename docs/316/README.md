# Research: a Rofi like experience on MacOSX

On my arch linux machine I use rofi as my program launcher and finder. The feature that I use the most is looking for desktop applications to launch. This in is in contrast to the builtin spotlight on MacOSX that finds an application that is already launch and switches focus. This is typically the behavior that I don't want.

One solution that I ran into is a gui fzf application that may be used from the command line called `choose`. It may be possible to use `skhd`, `choose`, and a bash script that talks to yabai to pull it off.
