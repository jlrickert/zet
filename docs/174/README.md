# My personal website design

This is my personal website that will be at https://jlrickert.me or
https://jlrickert.github.io.

The design of it is to be a retro terminal inspired by bash bunni and 4s3ti.
However, that seems like it will take some work and doesn't have much value. It
would be a stretch goal. For now I just need something simple.

## Sitemap

- Home

  This should have basic things about me.

- Zettelkasten

  Simply a link to my public notes for now. Maybe at some point I will do
  something different.

- Blog
- About
- Resume
- Portfolio
- Contact me
