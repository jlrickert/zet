# Hardware: 42" Flexispot corner raiser

Corner riser that sits on top of a desk to allowing transitioning between sitting and standing. Around 320$ at the [Office Depot]. Cheaper than a full adjustable sizing desk. Keyboard tray takes up quite a bit of room when set the down position. Market seems to average about 50$ all the way up to 150$. 50$ seems to be the most common
