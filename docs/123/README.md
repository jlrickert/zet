# Problems with Linux as a workstation

Here are some common

- Tiling window managers are too minimal
- Hardware compatibility tends to be problematic. For example, the WIFI
  on my desktop tends to drop packets. Works fine under windows.
- Gnome desktop is buggy
- Different way to manage time between windows and Linux.
- Can't configure some hardware devices such as keyboard on mouse under
  Linux.
- Usually end up dual booting with windows adding some extra complexity
- Easier to disable secure boot so no TPM out of the box
- Screen sharing is broken on Linux
- Common cross-platform software is missing features. Zoom for example
  doesn't have blur
