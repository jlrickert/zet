# Prompt: converting tables in word documents to markdown tables

One trick that I found is to copy and paste the contents of a word document into vim. The contents will be garbage. I feed it into chat gpt to the format.

Known issues with this approach:

- converts checkboxes to either 1 or 0. I prefer [x] and [ ]
