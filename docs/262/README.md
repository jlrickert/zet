# Seamless navigation between tmux and vim

This is something I have been looking into. I did find that there is a repository up on [github] and a couple of blogs about. One from the [author] and one from another from a random [blog]. It allows navigating out of vim to tmux with a custom keybinds. Haven't figured out how to use the tmux prefix between both vim and tmux or use the `<leader>w functions`.
