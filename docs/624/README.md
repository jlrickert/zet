# Information normalization in note taking

The idea of normalization is well know in databases. Not so much for everyday life.

Pros:

- Able to reconnect a not to different areas

  For example, a concept in linear algebra can be used in computer graphics, physics, and mathematics. One idea linked in multiple places. Why retake notes when you don't have to

Cons:

- Notes scattered everywhere

  That's why I use neovim and zellij to help managed file spaghetti.
