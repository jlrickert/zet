# Recommendations for good sleep

Some one asked me about some actionable things about sleep. This was my recommendations that I put on the post.

What does good sleep look like

- Should take around 20 minutes to fall asleep. If you fall asleep instantly this suggests that you are not getting enough sleep. To measure when you fall asleep and wake up actigraphy works well. This could be sensors on your bed or a smartwatch. Fitbit was good in my experience. My Garmin Forerunner 245 didn't work well for this. 955 works well.
- Should wake up at a consistent time feeling refreshed all morning.
- HRV is another metric to look at that is greatly affect by sleep quality and duration. Not an easy thing to measure but it is a good indicator. Only thing accurate is an EKG chest strap. My forerunner does HRV. Might be good enough to get a decent trend line.

Ways to improve sleep.

- Avoid digesting food before you go to bed. What this means is don't eat too much before bedtime. It is generally recommended to not eat anything 3 hours prior. A light dinner is best. You don't want to go too long without eating prior to sleeping as this raises stress hormones.
- Avoid oversleeping
- Be consistent in your sleep schedule. Typically there is a range of bed times that you can schedule when you sleep regularly. Going to bed at lets say 4am and waking up at 11:30am regularly will prioritize what sleep cycle is dominant and could result lower sleep quality. This is highly variable between individuals.
- Getting a large dose of sunlight in the morning. This helps set your circadian rhythm.
- Getting some sunlight in the evening. This helps set your circadian rhythm.
- Avoid light exposure near bed time. This is things like phones screens. If you do need to look at a phone screen keep it as low as possible in your field of vision. Red light is fine.
- Spend time in nature. Green reflects infrared radiation. This penetrates down into our cells that does interesting things at the cellular level. This does something for stress management.
- Avoid alcohol. I have found that even 1 drink will impair my ability to fall asleep and get a deep rest.
- Finds ways to lower stress prior to bed time. Cortisol keeps you awake.
- Get some exercise. Exercise promotes higher quality sleep. It is preferable to get earlier in the day as exercise temporarily raises stress hormones that makes it hard to sleep. Some exercise is better than none. Too intense of exercise can also be a problem. I find anything over 2 hours (long runs) will make lengthen the duration to fall asleep. I usually can't fall asleep at all after a 50k.
- Most people should avoid caffeine mid to late in the day. It is preferable to wait at least an hour after waking up to have a cup of coffee. Your body naturally will elevate your cortisol levels to get you up in the morning. This will naturally fall as the day goes on. Coffee will help keep it up and waiting will help prevent a crash. Cortisol is your friend here. There a few genetic quirks that make it so you metabolize caffeine faster than normal. If you have the gene you can have caffeine whenever and be fine.
- Eat a balanced meal. If the body has everything that it needs things tend to work better. Avoid ultra processed foods like the plague. Get the recommended amount of fiber from a diverse range of foods. Closer to its natural form the better. Fiber plus a little bit of fermented food is a really good combination. This consistent lowers systemic inflammation in lots of studies. Promotes a healthy gut. Healthy gut healthy brain.
- There are a few genetic quirks where some people sleep better eating a very light carby snack just prior to bed time. This could be something like rice, oatmeal, icecream, etc. This is rather rare though.

Please note a lot of this is from memory and may be inaccurate. I don't remember where I got a lot of this from. Many are from books that I have and podcasts from experts in the field of neurology and biology. Here some sources:

- Andrew Huberman podcasts
- The circadian code (Satchin Panda)
- couple of places that I don't remember
