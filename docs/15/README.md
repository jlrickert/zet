# How to quickly test out space vim

Spacevim is a vim version of spacemacs. One of the key features that is promises is the consistent experience between terminal and GUI. One thing that I am hoping is that it is fast to load up

```
docker pull spacevim/spacevim
docker run -it --rm spacevim/spacevim nvim
```
