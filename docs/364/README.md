# Setup OpenSearch AWS for learning

WIP

This is a how to guide to setup AWS OpenSearch in the free tier for
experimenting.

## Free tier requirements

> You can get started for free on OpenSearch Service with AWS Free Tier. For
> customers in the AWS Free Tier, OpenSearch Service provides free usage of up
> to 750 hours per month of a t2.small.search or t3.small.search instance, which
> are entry-level instances typically used for test workloads, and 10 GB per
> month of optional Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) storage. If you exceed the
> Free Tier usage limits, you will be charged the OpenSearch Service rates for
> the additional resources you use. See offer terms for more details.

To summarize

- use t2.small.search or t3.small.search instances
- 10 GBS of EBS storage
