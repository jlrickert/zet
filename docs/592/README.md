# Issue: Sticking issues with baking

Issue ran into when backing

## Pyrex

- With parchment paper

  Works. This is the strategy used for the [Memorial day foccacia](../561)

- Oiling the bottom before placing bread down

  Helped but not as good as the parchment paper method. This is what I did for my [mid week bake](../588)

- No oil

  It stuck. This is the method used for the [Fathers Day Weekend focaccia 2024](../591). One thing to export is no oil at a lower temperature. I think the way the oven is setup it gets too high of heat at the bottom. This may create a new issue though

## Cast Iron

Tried it out on my first [100% whole wheat bread](../608). Worked beautifully.
