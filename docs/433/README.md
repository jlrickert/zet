# Recommended wine list

## Cabernet

Some that I have tried and did not like:

- Dark horse

  Very dry but cheap. Maybe OK for cooking.

- 14 hands - hot to trot

  A smooth red blend. Very good tasting

- Menage a Trois - Cabernet Sauvignon

  My go to steak wine

## Shiraz

- Some Australian wine from 2016. Forgot to take a note of the name.

  Reminded Scott of the Meat loaf red wine

## Others

- Wine Haven | Honey wine

  Also know as mead. Honey like taste.

- Meat loaf red wine
