# MX Vertical mouse

This is an premium ergonomic mouse. I find it very comfortable.

Some of the features of the mouse is that It has 3 ways to connect to
devices. A unifying receiver, Bluetooth, and with a cord.

One advantage of using the receiver, and/or Bluetooth is that there is a
button on the bottom that allows switching between devices. For the most
part switching devices works seamlessly between MacOS and Windows. With
Gnome Bluetooth turns off and you have to reconnected if you switch
devices. Reconnecting requires a mouse.

One issue that I occasionally have is that I need to repair it with the
receiver. This can be done with the [unifying software].
