# July fourth weekend 2023 sourdough pizza

Pizza that I made for the fourth of July weekend.

| Ingredient  | Weight | Bakers percentage | Comment                |
| ----------- | ------ | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| AP Flour    | 400g   | 80%               | Walmart organic flour  |
| Whole wheat | 100g   | 20%               | Hard red wheat         |
| Water       | 325g   | 66%               |                        |
| rye starter | 50g    | 10%               | 100% rye; 1 to 1 ratio |
| Salt        |        | 1%                | I just winged it       |

Total weight is rough 875g

Here is the timings

- 12:30pm I mixed and placed in the fridge
- 8:00am I took it out of the fridge
- Random stretch and folds throughout the day. Nothing crazy

Turned out rather sticky. Still came out good.
