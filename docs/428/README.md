# Guesswork Sourdough bread

Here is the list of ingredients:

| Ingredient        | Amount | Comment                       |
| ----------------- | ------ | ----------------------------- |
| All purpose flour | 400g   | organic ap flour from walmart |
| Water             | 250g   |                               |
| starter           | 100g   | 100% whole wheat 1:1          |

All ingredients here a guess. The water amount may be the only some what close measurement. Everything is based off of that amount. I had to wing it.

Here are the key events

- fed starter at 11 am
- Mixed everything at 5:30pm
- Placed in fridge at like 11pm
- Shaped at 9am
- baked at 10:30 am
